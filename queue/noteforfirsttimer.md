in python queue can be implemented in either list or deque 
the deque one is more easier for me

Using a list as a queue in Python is not recommended for performance reasons.

Python. deque is implemented as a doubly-linked list, which allows for fast appends and pops from both ends of the queue with a time complexity of O(1).

# tree
tree is a non linear structure
- used to represent hierachical datas
eq- folder structure
trie rre used to represent dictonary
suffix tree is used to do fast searching in tree

# binary tree
- atmost 2 node
each node have three field: left reference,
right reference and the data
# binary search tree is the most used and it is a variation of binary tree

# tree traversal
boardly categories in two: 
1. breath first -> going from left to right on level base . from the root
2. depth first - preorder, inorder, postorder
dfs is like first the root then the left subtree then the right subtree
usually prefer with recursion
- in all these three bfs method, left subtree are always considered first
inorder-(left,root,right) ----mostly used
preorder-(root,left,right)
postorder-(left,right,root)
